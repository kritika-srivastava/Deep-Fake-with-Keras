### Dependencies
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Steps involved :
- Loading the MNIST dataset
- Select a subset of the database containing zeroes 
- Make a discriminator model to discriminate between the output images generated by generator and the actual Dataset images.
- Make a generator model to train over the dataset and generate similar images.
- Train the GAN to display the developed 25 images.
